    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><p>Gather all your ingredients.</p></li>
        <img src="/images/storing_ingr.jpg" alt="All Ingredients" width="400"   height="300">
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p></li>
        <img src="/images/step2.jpg" alt="Mixing the meat" width="400" height="300">
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <img src="/images/mixing.jpg" alt="Mixed Meat" width="400" height="300">
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong><p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong><p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Step 8:</strong><p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Step 9:</strong><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p></li>
        <img src="/images/step9.jpg" alt="Almost Ready" width="400" height="300">
        <li><strong>Step 10:</strong><p>Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before cutting; this helps it set and firm up.</p></li>
